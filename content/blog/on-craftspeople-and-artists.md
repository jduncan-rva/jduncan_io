For years now, my job has been working with different groups in different organizations to find success and recover from failure. Because of this work, when asked what I'm an "expert" in, my answer is "I'm an expert in experience." Technologies come in and out of vogue. But experience and perspective is how you effectively solve problems.

I'm afforded this privilege by interfacing with mulitple teams across all of my customers to solve all sorts of problems. This experience makes me distrust most marketing materials and spend inordinate amounts of time thinking about the definition of terms that our industry takes for granted at scale. I've seen [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and [DevOps](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) defined in more ways than the truth on Capitol Hill.
