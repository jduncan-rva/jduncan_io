It seems like you can't throw a rock and not hit some IT wonk talking about their new podcast. Well, here's another one. 

Myself, [John Osborne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnfosborneiii/) and [Tariq Islam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tariqmislam/) have gotten together to being producing [The K Files](https://kfiles.com). 

Our goal each episode is to take a single topic relevant to Kubernetes or IT in general and dig as deep as we can into it. Our goal is to get to the bottom. We won't always succeed there, but hopefully The K Files will keep a solid batting average. 

You can find The K Files on your podcast app and also at https://episodes.k8sfiles.com. 

Feedback is always beyond welcome, as well as ideas for episodes!
